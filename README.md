#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining Software systems.
The importances are: It helps in solving real world problems by developing apps and programs that solve this problems.
                     Ensures better use of resources
                     Ensures that systems run smoothly.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Birth of structured programming
The rise of Object Oriented Programming
The rise of Agile Methodology 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: laying down project goals, resources and timelines
Requirements Phase: gathering and documenting Software requirements
Design Phase: Creating an detailed design pof the software
Implementation Phase: code is written in this phase
Testing: verifying and validating the software to ensure that it meets all requirements and its free from defects
Deployment: It is deployed into production ie installing, configurations
Maintenance: ensuring that the code is free from bugs, improving performance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

In Waterfall struture is linear and sequential whereas in agile it is iterative and incremental.
In Agile flexibility is High changes can be made in each sprint for contionous improvements whereas in waterfall it is less flxible since it is hard to change once the project has started
User involvement in agile is high whereas in waterfall iy is low
waterfall scenario: Development of a government compliance system
Agile scenarion: Development of a mobile app for startup


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Dev
writtinfg and maintaining code to create Software apps
designing and implementing Software architecture and components
debugging and resolving software issues and bugs

QA
Designing, developing and executing test plans and test cases
Identifying snd documenting defects and issues in Software
Ensure that the software meets quality starndards and requirements

Project Manager
Planning, coordinating and managing software development projects
Defining project scope goals and deliverables
Creating and maintaining project schedules and timelines


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software 
development process. Give examples of each.

Increased Productivity: IDEs streamline the development process by integrating various tools into a single environment. This eliminates the need to switch between different applications, saving time and effort.   
Improved Code Quality: Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error checking help developers write cleaner and more error-free code.   
Simplified Debugging: IDEs provide powerful debugging tools that allow developers to identify and fix errors more efficiently. VS studio
Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.   
Version History: VCS keeps a complete history of all changes made to the code, allowing developers to track who made changes, when, and why.   
Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation and then merge those changes back into the main codebase. ie Git

   


   



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging and Problem Solving: Finding and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Code Complexity: Large and complex codebases can be difficult to understand and maintain.
Constantly Evolving Technology:The tech landscape changes rapidly. New languages, frameworks, and tools emerge constantly, requiring continuous learning.
strategies
Continuous Learning: Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.   
Problem-Solving Skills: Develop strong problem-solving and analytical skills.   
Communication Skills: Practice effective communication, both written and verbal.   
Collaboration Skills: Learn to work effectively in a team environment.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing focuses on testing the smallest testable parts of a software application, called "units."
Integration testing verifies that different units or components of the software work together correctly.
System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole.It checks that all components work together seamlessly and that the system meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance testing is performed by the end-users or clients to determine if the system meets their requirements and is acceptable for release.







#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective input prompts for AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs).It involves carefully structuring and phrasing instructions to guide the AI towards generating desired, accurate, and relevant responses. 

Improving Accuracy and Relevance: By crafting precise prompts, we can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of the AI's output. This is crucial for tasks like question answering, text summarization, and code generation.   
Controlling the AI's Behavior: Prompt engineering allows us to guide the AI's behavior and steer it towards desired responses. We can specify the format, style, and tone of the output, and even provide constraints or limitations.   
Reducing Ambiguity: Natural language can be ambiguous, and AI models are susceptible to misinterpretations.Well-crafted prompts can reduce ambiguity and ensure that the AI understands the intended meaning.   





Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague "Write something about cats."
detailed "Write a short paragraph (around 150 words) about the history of domestic cats for an audience of teenagers. Focus on how they were domesticated and their role in ancient Egyptian society.  Use a slightly informal, engaging tone."
